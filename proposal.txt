Project Proposal

1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?

	Users will be able to retrieve the Old Testament and New Testament verses, chapters, and books.

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?

	Christians and people that want to learn more about what the Bible says but maybe don't own a physical copy.
	Unfortunately this API only supports the "Bible in Basic English" version, so the user will have to
	understand english.

3. What data do you plan on using? 

	I am planning on using the Holy Bible API from the 'rapidapi' website.
	Data includes books, verses, chapters, and getting verses by the chapters.

4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project.

	a. What does your database schema look like?
		My schema has 
		-a section for the new testament and the old testament which contains
		the books for each. 
		-a section to get chapters which contains the book, the chapter,
		and the output for that chapter.
		-a section to get verses which contains the book, the chapter,
		the versefrom, the verseto, and the output of those verses.

	b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
		I am not sure. I am just predicting lots of bugs. 

	c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
		No, I don't see the advantage of requiring
		the client to create an account thus requiring the
		encryption of a password.

	d. What functionality will your app include?
		App will be able to retrieve data from the whole Bible, though
		restricted by the version it uses. 

	e. What will the user flow look like?
		The user will be able to search for a list of all the books in the new and old testament, 
		will be able to search for a list of all the chapters in each book, and will be able to 
		search for specific verses.

	f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch
	goals?
		I do not, should I?
